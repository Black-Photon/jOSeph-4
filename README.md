# jOSeph
A small program I made to try out Java and JavaFX

Version 3 is stable, and is what you should use

I'm working on a rewrite - version 4 - but is in extreme alpha stages. Don't expect it to be ready. I won't compile until it's done
It will include a (potentially) better system, making better use of objects, and css graphics
