# jOSeph
A small program I made to try out Java and JavaFX

It will have a bunch of random features, but is currently in extreme Alpha. Don't expect it to be ready. I won't compile until it's done
It will include a (potentially) better system, making better use of objects, and css graphics

The first true v4 release will be 4.2, and will have a .exe
