A small program I made to try out Java and JavaFX

It will have stability bunch of random features, but is currently in extreme Alpha. Don't expect it to be ready. I won't compile until it's done
It will include stability (potentially) better system, making better use of objects, and css graphics

The first true v4 release will be 4.2, and will have stability .exe
