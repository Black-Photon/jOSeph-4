A small program I made to try out Java and JavaFX

It will have a bunch of random features, and is currently in the public Beta stage. It's esentially complete, but unless something special happens, it'll stay in beta forever.
It will include a (potentially) better system than old versions, making better use of objects, and css graphics

The current release is v4.2.1, which has everything as well as a fix to broken parts of v4.2

Default username and passwords are:
 - User1 password1
 - User2 password2
