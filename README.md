# jOSeph
A small program I made to try out Java and JavaFX

4/4/18: Currently closed in terms of updates - I've moved onto other things, so unless I get a good reason to carry it on, 4.2.1 will be the last update. Sorry about the issues not yet closed, but the project was really to get a better understanding of Java, something it did outstandingly. If you do happen to use it - I hope you like it! It's my first released project. Right now I've moved to planet clicker (name still not decided), found here https://github.com/Black-Photon/Planet-Clicker so check it out when it's finished!

It has loads of different things that will likely never be needed. In a release, so if interested in randomness, it'll be great!
It will include a (potentially) better system than version 3, making better use of objects, and css graphics.
It was made for me to understand java rather than accomplish a purpose. If you enjoy it despite this, great!

The current release is v4.2.1, which has everything as well as a fix to broken parts of v4.2.
